![Challenge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Challenge-90DaysOfCode-orange)

A classic Turtle Crossing arcade-style game built using Python’s turtle module as part of my #90DaysOfCode challenge.
The project focuses on object-oriented programming, real-time game loops, collision detection, and progressive difficulty while reinforcing clean code structure and game logic fundamentals.

# 🚀 Features


🐢 Player-controlled turtle with keyboard input

🚗 Randomly generated moving cars as obstacles

💥 Collision detection between player and cars

📈 Level progression with increasing difficulty

📊 On-screen scoreboard with level tracking

🛑 Game-over screen on collision

🧠 Clean OOP-based architecture with separate game components

# 🖥 A turtle graphics window will open.

Up Arrow → Move forward

Down Arrow → Move backward

Reach the top safely to advance levels while avoiding incoming cars.

# 🧩 Concepts Practiced


Python Turtle Graphics

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Class inheritance and modular design

Game loops and real-time updates

Collision detection and event handling

State management (levels & speed)

Clean multi-file project structure

A hands-on project to strengthen core Python fundamentals through game development

---
# 🔮 Future Improvements


Add win condition after a maximum level

Introduce lives instead of instant game over

Sound effects and animations

Pause/resume functionality

Difficulty modes

GUI-based version

A roadmap for extending the project into a more complete and scalable game
